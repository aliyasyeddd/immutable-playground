Immutable Practice Goals

This repository is a small hands-on playground to practice and understand immutable data handling in JavaScript using Immutable.js.

🎯 Goals

Learn the fundamentals of immutability and persistent data structures.

Practice using Immutable.js collections — Map, List, Set, and Record.

Understand how to update data immutably without mutating the original state.

Build small mini-projects to apply concepts in real-world scenarios.

Strengthen understanding of state management and performance optimization in frontend apps.

🧠 Mini Project Ideas

Todo List Manager – Manage tasks using Immutable List.

Crypto Info Viewer – Store API data in an Immutable Map.

Quote Explorer – Keep a recent quotes history using Immutable List.

Movie Explorer – Track recently viewed movies immutably.

User Watchlist – Add/remove items immutably in a collection.
